# AI-based_recruitment_platform
## AIM : 
 I’ll show you here how you can start building an AI-based recruitment platform. Here I am using the Resume dataset from Kaggle to make a NLP model.

## The following are the concepts, tools, and libraries that I used to build this prototype:
Semantic search.
Embeddings.
Facebook Faiss.
Hugginface’s Transformers.
Huggingface’s datasets.
Openai’s GPT-3.
A resume dataset hosted on Kaggle.

## Requirement OpenAI key
Open OpenAI website(https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create key , It will use in code.

## Install some pckages on which our dependency

       !pip install datasets evaluate transformers[sentencepiece]
       !pip install faiss-cpu
       !pip install -U sentence-transformers
       !pip install openai
       !pip install pandas
 
## To Run Code 
        Here, I'm using Jupyter Notebook to write code so you can run code to select cell from above to down.
